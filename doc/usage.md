# Usage

1. Select the text for which you'll search

    ![select text](./sel.png)

1. Click "Find Similar Text"

    ![click](./click.png)

    If all goes well you'll see a histogram in the left corner and this text and similar highlighted.

    ![good outcome](./good.png)

1. If you didn't get what you want, e.g. a cluster of numbers made the regexp too strict:

    ![bad outcome](./bad.png)

    1. You can go to the popup and (1) manually refine the regexp or click "Generalize" to try to capture more

        ![generalize more](./gen.png)

    2. And hope to capture what you wanted

        ![desired](./desired.png)
